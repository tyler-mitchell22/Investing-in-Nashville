Real Estate Investment – Predictive Analytics (Nashville Housing Data)

This project applies machine learning techniques to real estate data from the Nashville area to help identify properties with strong value opportunities for investment.
The target variable is “Sale Price Compared to Value”, which classifies each transaction as either over-valued or under-valued relative to its assessed market value.
